## Channel Logo Guidelines

Since finding a suitable logo for the channel is not always possible, this list contains only recommendations and should just help you in choosing a logo from several options.

1. If the channel logo has several versions, it is better to choose a color one.

   That way there is less chance of the logo blending in with the background.

   <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7253922/235551685-34cbb982-078f-42b8-9fb3-2800afc80abe.png" width="600"/>

2. If the logo has changed over time, use the latest version.

3. If the channel has several versions of the logo, it is better to use the one used on air.

4. If there is a transparent background around the logo is better to cut it.

   That way it's much easier to scale the logo later.

## Project Structure

- `.github/`
  - `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`: issue templates for the repository.
  - `workflows`: contains [GitHub actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart) workflows.
  - `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`: rules you shouldn't break if you don't want to get banned.
- `.readme/`
  - `preview.png`: image displayed in the `README.md`.
- `data/`: contains all data.
- `scripts/`: contains all scripts used in the repository.
- `tests/`: contains tests to check the scripts.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: file you are currently reading.
- `README.md`: project description displayed on the home page.

## Scripts

These scripts are created to automate routine processes in the repository and make it a bit easier to maintain.

For scripts to work, you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your computer.

To run scripts use the `npm run <script-name>` command.

- `act:check`: allows to run the [check](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv/blob/master/.github/workflows/check.yml) workflow locally. Depends on [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act).
- `act:update`: allows to run the [update](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv/blob/master/.github/workflows/update.yml) workflow locally. Depends on [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act).
- `act:deploy`: allows to run the [deploy](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy.yml) workflow locally. Depends on [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act).
- `db:validate`: checks the integrity of data.
- `db:export`: saves all data in JSON format to the `/.api` folder.
- `db:update`: triggers a data update using approved requests from issues.
- `lint`: —Åhecks the scripts for syntax errors.
- `test`: runs a test of all the scripts described above.

## Workflows

To automate the run of the scripts described above, we use the [GitHub Actions workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows).

Each workflow includes its own set of scripts that can be run either manually or in response to an event.

- `check`: runs the `db:validate` script when a new pull request appears, and blocks the merge if it detects an error in it.
- `update`: sequentially runs `db:update` and `db:validate` scripts and commits all the changes if successful.
- `deploy`: after each update of the [master](https://github.com/iptv-org/database/branches) branch runs the script `db:export` and then publishes the resulting files to the [iptv-org/api](https://github.com/iptv-org/api) repository.
